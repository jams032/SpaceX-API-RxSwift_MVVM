# SpaceX-API-RxSwift_MVVM
SpaceX-API version 4 implementation in iOS Swift(Rxswift) with MVVM model

So far i have done : 

1. Maintained MVVM design pattern
2. Used RXSwift 
3. Implement List and Details API (SpaceX)
4. Implement Filter (Lates, older , all data, successfull launches) in First screen. 
5. Had a few unit testing (ongoing more)

I will definitely do some refractoring like:
- create API manager
- improve some point DetailsViewModel as some Launch has no data, so loading data/sending param is not in good right format. 
- will perforom related Unit test too. 

I did not work too much on RXSwift, normally i'm used with native(swift) developement. I will cover all these within a month. Already i've started. 

Any suggestion is welcome. 

Thanks.
